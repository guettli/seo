# Search Engine Optimization

I lived in Intranet Wonderland several years. From 2001 until 2020 I developed web based software which was used
in the Intranet. 

But Intranet is different than Internet.

Search Engine Optimization is a big thing, in the Consumer-to-Business world.

## HTTP Status codes

Use http status 410 (not 404), if you know that there is been something, and you are sure this page will never came back again.

.. But: 

> In practice, I doubt you’ll see a noticeable difference at all between 404 and 410, so while it’s great to use 410 in situations where you’re sure, with regards to Google search, it’s not worth spending too much time on that decision or on its implementation.
